## 🎯 What Is an H1Z1 Aimbot?

An **aimbot** for H1Z1 is a cheat that automatically locks your crosshair onto enemy hitboxes — usually the head, chest, or any custom target zone. You can choose how aggressive or smooth it feels, with silent aim and triggerbot features for extra stealth or rage-mode play.
